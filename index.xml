      <description>Brackets make it possible for make command to identify defined variable. Without brackets ( round or curly ) make command will only consider the very next character after &amp;ldquo;$&amp;rdquo; sign as variable, leaving remainting characters of the actual word.
Consider below Makefile. Remember it&amp;rsquo;s Makefile so indentation is TAB.
all: @echo &amp;#34;Building all targets...&amp;#34; target1: VAR = Value_for_target1 target1: @echo &amp;#34;Building target1 with VAR set to $(VAR)&amp;#34; target2: VAR = Value_for_target2 target2: @echo &amp;#34;Building target2 with VAR set to $(VAR)&amp;#34; and if you run&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
In otherwords, it will have commands that you want to run to build your docker image.
Example file -
# This image is based on python:3.9 docker image from python:3.9 # install pandas in the base image. RUN pip install pandas # Make the entrypoint for this image as bash.</description>

      <description>If you are using linux machine chances are that you are already using xdg-open.
xdg-open is a utility used by system to open a file or URL in the user&amp;rsquo;s preferred application.
To run a specific program for a given type of file or URL all you have to do is create a .dekstop file and configure so that xdg-open can run mentioned program for you.
To do that create first a desktop file.</description>

      <description>At times you will maintain or use a git repo which contains another repo as a submodule. Sometimes when you update or add this submodule again you may end up error like this.
&amp;#39;main_repo/sub_repo&amp;#39; already exists in the index. To fix this run below command and try adding submodule again.
git rm -r --cached main_repo/sub_repo git submodule add --force -b main {repo_url} {folder_to_use_for_sub_repo} </description>

      <title>Change Git Remote URL via terminal</title>

      <description>I used to clone github repositories with https link. We could use our github credentials with Git command line.
However as of August 21, Github has removed support for using your account password from Git command line.
That means you either need to generate Personal Access Tokens or configure repo with ssh keys.
I prefer 2nd option and that would mean that I need to change remote url in my checkout repo.</description>

      <description>If you have installed Linux on a Thinkpad with X11 and feel trackpoint is sluggish to work with then give below config a try. Ideally this should work on any debian based linux distro.
Open a terminal and copy below snippet.
id=`xinput | grep -ie &amp;#34;TrackPoint&amp;#34; | awk &amp;#39;{ print $6 }&amp;#39; | awk &amp;#39;BEGIN{FS=&amp;#34;=&amp;#34;} {print $2}&amp;#39;` xinput set-prop $id &amp;#34;Coordinate Transformation Matrix&amp;#34; 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 1 What we are doing here is chaning X and Y sensitivities (set to 6) where both are 1 by default.</description>
